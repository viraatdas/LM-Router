[{"instruction": "At the arcade Dave won 11 tickets . If he spent 5 tickets on a beanie and later won 10 more tickets , how many would he have ?\n ", "input": "", "output": "Dave initially had 11 tickets. He spent 5 tickets on a beanie, leaving him with:\n\n11 - 5 = 6 tickets\n\nHe later won 10 more tickets, so his total number of tickets would be:\n\n6 + 10 = 16 tickets\n\nTherefore, Dave would have 16 tickets after spending 5 tickets on a beanie and winning 10 more tickets.

How fast is the rabbit?\n ", "input": "", "output": "Let's call the speed of the rabbit \"x\".\n\nThe problem tells us to take the fastest speed of a rabbit and double it, so we have:\n\n2x\n\nThen we add 4 to that:\n\n2x + 4\n\nAnd finally, we double it again to get 188:\n\n2(2x + 4) = 188\n\nSimplifying the equation, we can distribute the 2:\n\n4x + 8 = 188\n\nSubtracting 8 from both sides:\n\n4x = 180\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\nx = 45\n\nTherefore, the speed of the rabbit is 45.", "answer": "45.0"}, {"instruction": "Janet counts 30 crows on the powerlines and 60% more hawks than crows.
